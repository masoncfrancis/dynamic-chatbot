## Technology

Talk about how this chatbot would make exposure AI possible for young people who might not have access to smartphones. 
I didn't have a smartphone in high school so I can relate.

I used these technologies:
* Python
* Flask
* Twilio API
* OpenAI's ChatGPT API
* MySQL Server on Microsoft Azure Cloud
* Remote Server in Tooele
* Used Ngrok tunnel to expose server to internet securely

## Demo: 

0. Text asking who the assistant is
1. Text asking about NICE Systems
2. Set to Donald Trump
3. Ask what he would do if I ran in an election against him
4. Set to Nicki Minaj
5. Ask if shes a bad b
6. Set to Ted from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure
7. Ask what's the most excellent thing he can think of
8. Set to default
9. Call and ask about Lucid, the software company
10. Ask about the Space Dynamics Laboratory at USU

## Learning

While I was somewhat familiar with some areas of this project, I had to learn how to use the ChatGPT API. This is also my first 
time using Text to Speech in a project, especially in a call.
